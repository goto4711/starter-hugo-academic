abstract: Articulations of discontinuity and moments of dissent have been central
  to critical historical work. However, such vocabularies and analyses of historical
  change have received less attention in the emerging field of digital methods. Digital
  methods based on discerning patterns have focused on continuities, while discontinuities
  and ruptures have been derivative of trends and patterns. By contrast, genealogical
  methods attend to the entanglement of continuity and discontinuity, and focus on
  contingency and singularity. This article proposes to develop methods of computational
  genealogy to analyze multiple temporalities in historical discourses. We experiment
  with our proposed computational genealogy using the archive of Inaugural speeches
  by US presidents. In particular, we show that there is neither a linear advance
  to Trumptextquoterights rhetoric nor an exceptional rupture. Our analysis shows
  that Trumptextquoterights speech is much more the struggle of the Republicans with
  their own past ideas than struggles with Democrats.
