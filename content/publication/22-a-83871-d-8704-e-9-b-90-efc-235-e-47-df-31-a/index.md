abstract: This book chapter attempts to counter anxieties in the humanities and social
  science about the role of big data in research by focusing on approaches which,
  by being firmly grounded in the traditional values of disciplines, enhance existing
  methods to produce fruitful research. Big data poses many methodological challenges,
  but these pressures should prompt scholars to pay much closer attention to methodological
  issues than they have in the past.
