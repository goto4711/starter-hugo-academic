abstract: "Purpose: This paper aims to describe the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure\
  \ (EHRI) project's ongoing efforts to virtually integrate trans-national archival\
  \ sources via the reconstruction of collection provenance as it relates to copy\
  \ collections (material copied from one archive to another) and the co-referencing\
  \ of subject and authority terms across material held by distinct institutions.\
  \ Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a case study of approximately 6,000\
  \ words length. The authors describe the scope of the problem of archival fragmentation\
  \ from both cultural and technical perspectives, with particular focus on Holocaust-related\
  \ material, and describe, with graph-based visualisations, two ways in which EHRI\
  \ seeks to better integrate information about fragmented material. Findings: As\
  \ a case study, the principal contributions of this paper include reports on our\
  \ experience with extracting provenance-based connections between archival descriptions\
  \ from encoded finding aids and the challenges of co-referencing access points in\
  \ the absence of domain-specific controlled vocabularies. Originality/value: Record\
  \ linking in general is an important technique in computational approaches to humanities\
  \ research and one that has rightly received significant attention from scholars.\
  \ In the context of historical archives, however, the material itself is in most\
  \ cases not digitised, meaning that computational attempts at linking must rely\
  \ on finding aids which constitute much fewer rich data sources. The EHRI projecttextquoterights\
  \ work in this area is therefore quite pioneering and has implications for archival\
  \ integration on a larger scale, where the disruptive potential of Linked Open Data\
  \ is most obvious."
