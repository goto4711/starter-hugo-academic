Digital humanities is a growing scholarly domain, definitions of which vary but which generally involves the application of computers to research questions that fall within the traditional remit of the humanities. It includes many areas of research that overlap with publishing. An important aspect of digital humanities is therefore to question assumptions that digital publishing should produce faithful visual reproductions. We argue that this cannot be the only objective of digital humanities publishing, and rather that publishing needs to be understood as a range of modelling activities that aim to develop and communicate interpretations, whether consciously or not. The article introduces a selection of digital humanities publishing standards and systems that support a flexible digital representations of objects, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which emphasizes scholarly flexibility and collaboration.},
