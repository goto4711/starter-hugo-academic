abstract: This article provides an overview of digital humanities activities that
  relate to publishing. Digital humanities is a growing scholarly domain, definitions
  of which vary but which generally involves the application of computers to research
  questions that fall within the traditional remit of the humanities. It includes
  many areas of research that overlap with publishing. An important aspect of digital
  humanities is therefore to question assumptions that digital publishing should produce
  faithful visual reproductions. We argue that this cannot be the only objective of
  digital humanities publishing, and rather that publishing needs to be understood
  as a range of modelling activities that aim to develop and communicate interpretations,
  whether consciously or not. The article introduces a selection of digital humanities
  publishing standards and systems that support a flexible digital representations
  of objects, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which emphasizes scholarly
  flexibility and collaboration.
