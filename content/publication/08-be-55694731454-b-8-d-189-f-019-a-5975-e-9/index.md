abstract: In this article we present our ideas for an integrating activity for archival
  research on the Holocaust. We analyse how we can improve Holocaust-related collection
  descriptions for research, which we will make available online, and how EHRI provides
  travel grants for transnational access to existing infrastructures in Holocaust
  research. Both approaches help us overcome that Holocaust-related material is geographically
  dispersed and address the challenges for historical research stemming from the way
  documentation on the Holocaust has been attempted up to now.We have chosen to implement
  the EHRI integrated information resource using graph databases. With their emphasis
  on relationships, graph databases are particularly well suited for historical research
  in particular and humanities research in general. We analyse the architecture and
  implementation details of this novel approach and show how graph databases integrate
  with traditional ways of searching and browsing historical collections. This way,
  we support more advanced means of access to facts in the documents and enable deep
  semantically meaningful access to the documents. The innovation of EHRI lies in
  the combination of digital and non-digital means to integrate existing infrastructures.
  We believe this might be a model for many related research activities in the humanities.
