abstract: This short paper analyses an experimentcomparing the efficacy of several
  NamedEntity Recognition (NER) tools at extractingentities directly from the output
  of anoptical character recognition (OCR) work-flow. The authors present how they
  firstcreated a set of test data, consisting of rawand corrected OCR output manually
  annotatedwith people, locations, and organizations.They then ran each of the NER
  toolsagainst both raw and corrected OCR output,comparing the precision, recall,
  and F1score against the manually annotated data
