abstract: '\"Auf lange Sicht: Von den Geisteswissenschaften im e-Science Kontext zu
  einem Geisteswissenschaftlichen digitalen Okosystem\". In this paper we investigate
  the importance of research infrastructures for arts and humanities research. We
  seek to outline the development of a digital research infrastructure localised in
  the science and engineering domain and framed within the concept of e-Science. We
  define the primary characteristics of e-Science as big data and big structures such
  as the grid and high performance computing. We will attempt to demonstrate the transfer
  of the e-Science paradigm to the humanities and to assess what worked and what did
  not. We then suggest how thinking about technology and infrastructure through and
  within the humanities can lead to transformation and finish with a suggestion that
  the future for humanities research infrastructures is best framed around the emerging
  idea of a humanities specific digital ecosystem.'
