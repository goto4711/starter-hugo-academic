abstract: This paper introduces details of EHRItextquoterights approach to user-centric
  data integration across heterogeneous archival institutions using virtual collections.
  Virtual collections provide the means to re-unite archival material that has, through
  complex historical circumstances, been deposited in many physical locations. They
  also allow the creation of subject-specific groupings of material more closely comparable
  to archival research guides, and provide users with the ability to organise their
  own research in personalised ways.
