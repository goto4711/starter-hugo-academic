 abstract = {This paper introduces details of EHRI\textquoterights approach to user-centric data integration across heterogeneous archival institutions using virtual collections. Virtual collections provide the means to re-unite archival material that has, through complex historical circumstances, been deposited in many physical locations. They also allow the creation of subject-specific groupings of material more closely comparable to archival research guides, and provide users with the ability to organise their own research in personalised ways.},
