abstract: Are algorithms ruling the world today? Is artificial intelligence making
  life-and-death decisions? Are social media companies able to manipulate elections?
  As we are confronted with public and academic anxieties about unprecedented changes,
  this book offers a different analytical prism through which these transformations
  can be explored. Claudia Aradau and Tobias Blanke develop conceptual and methodological
  tools to understand how algorithmic operations shape the government of self and
  other. They explore the emergence of algorithmic reason through rationalities, materializations,
  and interventions, and trace how algorithmic rationalities of decomposition, recomposition,
  and partitioning are materialized in the construction of dangerous others, the power
  of platforms, and the production of economic value. The book provides a global trandisciplinary
  perspective on algorithmic operations, drawing on qualitative and digital methods
  to investigate controversies ranging from mass surveillance and the Cambridge Analytica
  scandal in the UK to predictive policing in the US, and from the use of facial recognition
  in China and drone targeting in Pakistan to the regulation of hate speech in Germany.
