abstract: Are algorithms ruling the world today? Is artificial intelligence
  making life-and-death decisions? Are social media companies able to manipulate
  elections? As we are confronted with public and academic anxieties about
  unprecedented changes, this book offers a different analytical prism through
  which these transformations can be explored. Claudia Aradau and Tobias Blanke
  develop conceptual and methodological tools to understand how algorithmic
  operations shape the government of self and other. They explore the emergence
  of algorithmic reason through rationalities, materializations, and
  interventions, and trace how algorithmic rationalities of decomposition,
  recomposition, and partitioning are materialized in the construction of
  dangerous others, the power of platforms, and the production of economic
  value. The book provides a global trandisciplinary perspective on algorithmic
  operations, drawing on qualitative and digital methods to investigate
  controversies ranging from mass surveillance and the Cambridge Analytica
  scandal in the UK to predictive policing in the US, and from the use of facial
  recognition in China and drone targeting in Pakistan to the regulation of hate
  speech in Germany.
