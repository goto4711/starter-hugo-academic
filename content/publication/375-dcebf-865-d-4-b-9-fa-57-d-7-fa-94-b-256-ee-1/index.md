abstract: Purpose – In 2010 the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)
  was funded to support research into the Holocaust. The project follows on from significant
  efforts in the past to develop and record the collections of the Holocaust in several
  national initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the efforts by EHRI
  to create a flexible research environment using graph databases. The authors concentrate
  on the added features and design decisions to enable efficient processing of collection
  information as a graph. Design/methodology/approach – The paper concentrates on
  the specific customisations EHRI had to develop, as the graph database approach
  is new, and the authors could not rely on existing solutions. The authors describe
  the serialisations of collections in the graph to provide for efficient processing.
  Because the EHRI infrastructure is highly distributed, the authors also had to invest
  a lot of effort into reliable distributed access control mechanisms. Finally, the
  authors analyse the user-facing work on a portal and a virtual research environment
  (VRE) in order to discover, share and analyse Holocaust material. Findings – Using
  the novel graph database approach, the authors first present how we can model collection
  information as graphs and why this is effective. Second, we show how we make collection
  information persistent and describe the complex access management system we have
  developed. Third, we outline how we integrate user interaction with the data through
  a VRE. Originality/value – Scholars require specialised access to information. The
  authors present the results of the work to develop integrated research with collections
  on the Holocaust researchers and the proposals for a socio-technical ecosystem based
  on graph database technologies. The use of graph databases is new and the authors
  needed to work on several innovative customisations to make them work in the domain.
