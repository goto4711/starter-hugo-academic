abstract: Digital asset management is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Near
  universal availability of high-quality web-based assets makes it important to pay
  attention to the new world of digital ecosystems and what it means for managing,
  using and publishing digital assets. The Ecosystem of Digital Assets reflects on
  these developments and what the emerging 'web of things' could mean for digital
  assets. The book is structured into three parts, each covering an important aspect
  of digital assets. Part one introduces the emerging ecosystems of digital assets.
  Part two examines digital asset management in a networked environment. The third
  part covers media ecosystems.
