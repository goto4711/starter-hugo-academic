abstract: In this short paper we discuss our work on developing a data infrastructure
  for Holocaust research. Faced with the challenge of integrating data with widely
  varying characteristics, we decided to pursue an approach based on the property
  graph model and corresponding graph databases. These provide intuitive modelling
  capabilities and the ability to fluently evolve in structure to meet the needs of
  the data but require more basic implementation work, as the technology is less mature.
