 abstract = {In this short paper we discuss our work on developing a data infrastructure for Holocaust research. Faced with the challenge of integrating data with widely varying characteristics, we decided to pursue an approach based on the property graph model and corresponding graph databases. These provide intuitive modelling capabilities and the ability to fluently evolve in structure to meet the needs of the data but require more basic implementation work, as the technology is less mature.},
