abstract: From textquoteleftconnecting the dotstextquoteright and finding textquoteleftthe
  needle in the haystacktextquoteright to predictive policing and data mining for
  counterinsurgency, security professionals have increasingly adopted the language
  and methods of computing for the purposes of prediction. Digital devices and big
  data appear to offer answers to a wide array of problems of (in)security by promising
  insights into unknown futures. This paper investigates the transformation of prediction
  today by placing it within governmental apparatuses of discipline, biopower and
  big data. Unlike disciplinary and biopolitical governmentality, we argue that prediction
  with big data is underpinned by the production of a different time/space of textquoteleftbetween-nesstextquoteright.
  The digital mode of prediction with big data reconfigures how we are governed today,
  which we illustrate through an analysis of how predictive policing actualises between-ness
  as hotspots and near-real-time decisions.
