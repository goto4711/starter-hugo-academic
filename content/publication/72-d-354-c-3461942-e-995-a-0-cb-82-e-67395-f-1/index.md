abstract: Over the course of the past century, there have been significant changes
  in the practices of archives driven by the massive increase in the volume of records
  for archiving, a larger and more diverse user base, and the digital turn. This paper
  analyses work undertaken by the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project
  (EHRI) to develop heritage archives into research infrastructures by connecting
  their knowledge and making it relevant for research. In the article, we focus on
  EHRI's work on an integrated collection portal, acting as a central gateway to the
  rich information on Holocaust-related sources. At the time of writing, the portal
  contains over 150,000 descriptions of over 1,850 institutions that hold Holocaust-related
  archival material in 51 countries. In addition, it hosts concise reports that provide
  in-depth per-country information about the Holocaust history and archival situation
  in 47 countries, topic-focused research guides, and a range of other services. The
  article presents how the EHRI portal work connects to the state of the art of heritage
  portals and the novel solutions we had to develop to align the portal with the requirements
  of a research infrastructure.
