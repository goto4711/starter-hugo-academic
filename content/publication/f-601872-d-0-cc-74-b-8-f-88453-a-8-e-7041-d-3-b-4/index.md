abstract: We present a theoretical framework to evaluate XML retrieval. XML retrieval
  deals with retrieving those document components—the XML elements—that specifically
  answer a query. In this article, theoretical evaluation is concerned with the formal
  representation of qualitative properties of retrieval models. It complements experimental
  methods by showing the properties of the underlying reasoning assumptions that decide
  when a document is about a query. We define a theoretical methodology based on the
  idea of “aboutness” and apply it to current XML retrieval models. This allows comparing
  and analyzing the reasoning behavior of XML retrieval models experimented within
  the INEX evaluation campaigns. For each model we derive functional and qualitative
  properties that qualify its formal behavior. We then use these properties to explain
  experimental results obtained with some of the XML retrieval models.
