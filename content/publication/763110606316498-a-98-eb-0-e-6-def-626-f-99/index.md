abstract: In this article, we add research on technical integration and dependency
  to the theories of platformization. Our research seeks to understand how platforms
  have been able to technically integrate themselves into the fabric of the mobile
  ecosystem, transforming the economic dynamics that allow these largely enclosed
  entities to compete. We therefore want to consider platforms as service assemblages
  to account for the material ways in which they have decomposed and recomposed themselves
  for developers, enabling them to shift the economic dynamics of competition and
  monopolization in their favor. This article will argue that this shift in the formation
  of platform monopolies is being brought about by the decentralization of these services,
  leading to an overall technical integration of the largest digital platform such
  as Facebook and Google into the source code of almost all apps. We present new digital
  methodologies to surface these relations and material conditions of platforms. These
  methodologies offer us a whole new toolkit to investigate how decentralized services
  depend on each other and how new power relations are formed.
