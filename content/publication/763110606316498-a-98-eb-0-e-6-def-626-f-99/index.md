abstract: In this article, we add research on technical integration and
  dependency to the theories of platformization. Our research seeks to
  understand how platforms have been able to technically integrate themselves
  into the fabric of the mobile ecosystem, transforming the economic dynamics
  that allow these largely enclosed entities to compete. We therefore want to
  consider platforms as service assemblages to account for the material ways in
  which they have decomposed and recomposed themselves for developers, enabling
  them to shift the economic dynamics of competition and monopolization in their
  favor. This article will argue that this shift in the formation of platform
  monopolies is being brought about by the decentralization of these services,
  leading to an overall technical integration of the largest digital platform
  such as Facebook and Google into the source code of almost all apps. We
  present new digital methodologies to surface these relations and material
  conditions of platforms. These methodologies offer us a whole new toolkit to
  investigate how decentralized services depend on each other and how new power
  relations are formed.
