abstract: As digital technologies and algorithmic rationalities have increasingly
  reconfigured security practices, critical scholars have drawn attention to their
  performative effects on the temporality of law, notions of rights, and understandings
  of subjectivity. This article proposes to explore how the textquoteleftothertextquoteright
  is made knowable in massive amounts of data and how the boundary between self and
  other is drawn algorithmically. It argues that algorithmic security practices and
  Big Data technologies have transformed self/other relations. Rather than the enemy
  or the risky abnormal, the textquoteleftothertextquoteright is algorithmically produced
  as anomaly. Although anomaly has been often used interchangeably with abnormality
  and pathology, a brief genealogical reading of the concept shows that it works as
  a supplementary term, which reconfigures the dichotomies of normality/abnormality,
  friend/enemy, and identity/difference. By engaging with key practices of anomaly
  detection by intelligence and security agencies, the article analyses the materialisation
  of anomalies as specific spatial textquoteleftdotstextquoteright, temporal textquoteleftspikestextquoteright
  and topological textquoteleftnodestextquoteright. We argue that anomaly is not simply
  indicative of more heterogeneous modes of othering in times of Big Data, but represents
  a mutation in the logics of security that challenge our extant analytical and critical
  vocabularies.
