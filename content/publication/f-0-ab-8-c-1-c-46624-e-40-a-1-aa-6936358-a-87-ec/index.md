abstract: 'Doctoral theses are an important source of publication in universities,
  although little research has been carried out on the publications resulting from
  theses, on so-called derivative articles. This study investigates how derivative
  articles can be identified through a text analysis based on the full-text of a set
  of medical theses and the full-text of articles, with which they shared authorship.
  The text similarity analysis methodology applied consisted in exploiting the full-text
  articles according to organization of scientific discourse IMRaD (Introduction,
  Methodology, Results and Discussion) using the TurnItIn plagiarism tool. The study
  found that the text similarity rate in the Discussion section can be used to discriminate
  derivative articles from non-derivative articles. Additional findings were: the
  first position of the thesistextquoterights author dominated in 85 % of derivative
  articles, the participation of supervisors as coauthors occurred in 100 % of derivative
  articles, the authorship credit retained by the thesistextquoterights author was
  42 % in derivative articles, the number of coauthors by article was 5 in derivative
  articles versus 6.4 coauthors, as average, in non-derivative articles and the time
  differential regarding the year of thesis completion showed that 87.5 % of derivative
  articles were published before or in the same year of thesis completion.'
