abstract: 'The Snowden revelations and the emergence of textquoteleftBig Datatextquoteright
  have rekindled questions about how security practices are deployed in a digital
  age and with what political effects. While critical scholars have drawn attention
  to the social, political and legal challenges to these practices, the debates in
  computer and information science have received less analytical attention. This paper
  proposes to take seriously the critical knowledge developed in information and computer
  science and reinterpret their debates to develop a critical intervention into the
  public controversies concerning data-driven security and digital surveillance. The
  paper offers a two-pronged contribution: on the one hand, we challenge the credibility
  of security professionalstextquoteright discourses in light of the knowledge that
  they supposedly mobilize; on the other, we argue for a series of conceptual moves
  around data, humanâ€“computer relations, and algorithms to address some of the limitations
  of existing engagements with the Big Data-security assemblage.'
