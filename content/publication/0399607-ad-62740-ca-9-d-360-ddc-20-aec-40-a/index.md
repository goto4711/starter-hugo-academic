abstract: This article addresses an important challenge in artificial intelligence
  research in the humanities, which has impeded progress with supervised methods.
  It introduces a novel method to creating test collections from smaller subsets.
  This method is based on what we will introduce as distant supervisiontextquoteright
  and will allow us to improve computational modelling in the digital humanities by
  including new methods of supervised learning. Using recurrent neural networks, we
  generated a training corpus and were able to train a highly accurate model that
  qualitatively and quantitatively improved a baseline model. To demonstrate our new
  approach experimentally, we employ a real-life research question based on existing
  humanities collections. We use neural network based sentiment analysis to decode
  Holocaust memories and present a methodology to combine supervised and unsupervised
  sentiment analysis to analyse the oral history interviews of the United States Holocaust
  Memorial Museum. Finally, we employed three advanced methods of computational semantics.
  These helped us decipher the decisions by the neural network and understand, for
  instance, the complex sentiments around family memories in the testimonies.
