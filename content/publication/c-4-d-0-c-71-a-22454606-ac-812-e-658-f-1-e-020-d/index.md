abstract: 'In this article we introduce the concept of implied optical perspective
  in deep learning computer vision systems. Taking the BBCtextquoterights experimental
  television programme “Made by Machine: When AI met the Archive” (2018) as a case
  study, we trace a conceptual and material link between the system used to automatically
  “watch” the television archive and a specific type of photographic practice. From
  a computational aesthetics perspective, we show how deep learning machine vision
  relies on photography, its technical regimes and epistemic advantages, and we propose
  a novel way to identify the latent camera through which the BBC archive was seen
  by machine.'
