abstract: In this short paper we discuss our work on co-research devices with a young
  coder community, which help investigate big social data collected by mobile phones.
  The development was accompanied by focus groups and interviews on privacy attitudes
  and aims to explore how youth cultures are tracked in mobile phone data.
