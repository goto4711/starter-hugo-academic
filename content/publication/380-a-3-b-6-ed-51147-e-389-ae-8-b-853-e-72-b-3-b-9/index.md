abstract: This paper discusses how born-digital cultural material can be opened up
  for research. We focus in particular on the grey area between private mobile phone
  data and its publication and use for research and beyond. We report on the results
  of the `Empowering Data Citizens' (EDC) project, which is a collaboration between
  King's College London and the Open Data Institute. The work builds on the project
  Our Data Ourselves (http://big-social-data.net/), which studies the content we generate
  on our mobile devices, what we call big social data (BSD), and explores the possibilities
  of its ethical storage.
