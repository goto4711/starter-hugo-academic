abstract: This paper builds off the Our Data Ourselves research project, which examined
  ways of understanding and reclaiming the data that young people produce on smartphone
  devices. Here we explore the growing usage and centrality of mobiles in the lives
  of young people, questioning what data-making possibilities exist if users can either
  uncover and/or capture what data controllers such as Facebook monetize and share
  about themselves with third-parties. We outline the MobileMiner, an app we created
  to consider how gaining access to onetextquoterights own data not only augments
  the agency of the individual but of the collective user. Finally, we discuss the
  data making that transpired during our hackathon. Such interventions in the enclosed
  processes of datafication are meant as a preliminary investigation into the possibilities
  that arise when young people are given back the data which they are normally structurally
  precluded from accessing.
