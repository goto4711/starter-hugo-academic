abstract: 'In 2020, the European Union announced the award of the contract for the
  biometric part of the new database for border control, the Entry Exit System, to
  two companies: IDEMIA and Sopra Steria. Both companies had been previously involved
  in the development of databases for border and migration management. While there
  has been a growing amount of publicly available documents that show what kind of
  technologies are being implemented, for how much money, and by whom, there has been
  limited engagement with digital methods in this field. Moreover, critical border
  and security scholarship has largely focused on qualitative and ethnographic methods.
  Building on a data feminist approach, we propose a transdisciplinary methodology
  that goes beyond binaries of qualitative/quantitative and opacity/transparency,
  examines power asymmetries and makes the labour of coding visible. Empirically,
  we build and analyse a dataset of the contracts awarded by two European Union agencies
  key to its border management policies â€“ the European Agency for Large-Scale Information
  Systems (eu-LISA) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). We supplement
  the digital analysis and visualisation of networks of companies with close reading
  of tender documents. In so doing, we show how a transdisciplinary methodology can
  be a device for making datafication textquoteleftintelligibletextquoteright at the
  European Union borders.'
