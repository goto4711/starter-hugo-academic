abstract: The opacity of digital technologies has posed significant challenges for
  critical research and digital methods. In response, controversy mapping, reverse
  engineering and hacking have been key methodological devices to grapple with opacity
  and textquoteleftopen the black boxtextquoteright of digital ecosystems. We take
  recent developments in digital humanitarianism and the accelerated production of
  apps for refugees following the 2015 Mediterranean refugee crisis as a site of methodological
  experimentation to advance hacking as critical methodological interference. Drawing
  on the work of Michel Serres, we propose to understand digital technologies as textquoteleftparasitictextquoteright
  and reconceptualise hacking as textquoteleftacts of digital parasitismtextquoteright.
  Acts of digital parasitism are interferences that work alongside rather than work
  against. On one hand, this reworking of hacking advances an agenda for digital methods
  through reworking hacking for digital humanities and social science research. On
  the other, it allows us to show how the object of research – humanitarian apps –
  is configured through platformisation and incorporation within digital parasitic
  relations.
