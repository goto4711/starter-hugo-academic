Over the years we had a number of projects, helping citizens make sense of the datafication processes they are exposed to.

Our Data Ourselves from 2015-18 was the first project to look at mobile datafications. It was followed by collaborations with the Open Data Institute, the British Library, TacticalTech and many others.
